## Introduction

Auth Service is designed to streamline user authentication. Whether you're building a small web app or a large-scale system, it helps you manage user accounts, store passwords securely, and handle password recovery.

## Installation

To set up and run Auth Service, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```shell
   git clone  https://github.com/munuhee/auth-service.git
   cd auth-service
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
   ```shell
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use 'venv\Scripts\activate'
   ```

3. **Install the required packages:**
   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Create a `.env` file and set the necessary environment variables.** You can use `variables.env` as a template and update it with your values.

5. **Initialize the database and apply migrations:**
   ```shell
   flask db init
   flask db migrate
   flask db upgrade
   ```

6. **Start the application:**
   ```shell
   python run.py
   ```

The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:5000`. Customize the configuration in `config.py` to fit your needs.

## Configuration

The `config.py` file contains configuration settings for Auth Service. Set environment variables for secret keys, database URIs, email server settings, and more.

```plaintext
# .env

# Secret keys
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
REFRESH_SECRET_KEY=your_refresh_secret_key

# Database URI (SQLite example for development)
SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI=sqlite:///dev.db

# Flask Environment (use 'testing' for testing, 'development' for development, 'production' for production)
FLASK_ENV=development

# Flask-Mail configuration for sending email (update with your email server details)
MAIL_USERNAME=your_email_username
MAIL_PASSWORD=your_email_password
MAIL_DEFAULT_SENDER=your_email_sender
```

Replace placeholder values with your actual configuration details.


## Usage

Auth Service provides the following endpoints:

- **`GET /api/status`**: Check the health status of the application.
- **`POST /api/register`**: Register a new user.
- **`POST /api/login`**: Log in a user.
- **`POST /api/reset-password`**: Initiate a password reset request, verify reset tokens, and reset passwords.

You can interact with these endpoints using a RESTful API client or within your application.
